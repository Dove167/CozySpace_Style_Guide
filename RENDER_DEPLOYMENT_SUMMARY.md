# Render Deployment Summary

This document outlines the changes made to the local project and the current Render deployment settings for the monolithic Bun, Hono, React/Vite application.

## Summary of Local Project Changes

The following modifications were implemented to ensure a successful monolithic deployment to Render:

• **`client/package.json`**:
  • The `build` script was updated to `vite build`.
  • Duplicate dependencies (`picomatch`, `fdir`) were removed from `devDependencies`.

• **`client/vite.config.ts`**:
  • Added `build.outDir: "../dist"` to specify the output directory for the client build.
  • Added `server.proxy` configuration to handle API requests during local development.

• **`server/src/index.ts`**:
  • The server code was updated to uncomment and correctly serve static files from the `../dist` directory, enabling the Hono backend to serve the React frontend.
  • CORS configuration was adjusted to allow requests from the client.

• **Root `package.json`**:
  • The `scripts` section was updated to include `turbo` commands for `dev`, `build`, `lint`, `type-check`, and `test` across the monorepo.
  • A new `build:full` script was added: `turbo build --filter=client --filter=shared --filter=server` to build all workspaces.
  • The `dev` script was simplified to `turbo dev`.

• **`server/package.json`**:
  • The `dev` script was simplified to `bun --watch run src/index.ts` to remove unsupported background commands.

## Current Render Settings

Based on the `render.yaml` file, here are the current deployment settings:

• **Build Command:**
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash && export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" && bun install && bun run build:full
  ```
  This command first installs Bun, sets up its PATH, then installs project dependencies across the monorepo, and finally runs the full monorepo build script (`build:full`) to compile both the client and server.

• **Start Command:**
  ```bash
  bun server/dist/index.js
  ```
  This command starts the compiled Hono server, which is now configured to serve the static React frontend files.

• **Environment Variables:**
  • `KEY: NODE_ENV`
  • `VALUE: production`
  This environment variable is correctly set to `production` for the Render environment.

With these configurations, the application is set up for a monolithic deployment on Render, where the Hono server will serve the built React client. To deploy, commit these changes, push them to your Git repository, and Render will automatically handle the build and deployment process.
